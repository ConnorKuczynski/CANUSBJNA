CANUSBJNA
=========

[CANUSB](http://www.canusb.com/) is a dongle that plugs into any PC USB Port and gives an instant CAN connectivity. Drivers for Windows 32 bit and 64 bit are available. It can be treated by software as a standard COM Port. But communicating directly via the driver DLL allows faster communications and higher CAN bus loads. This library implements access to the native DLL using [Java Native Access (JNA)](https://github.com/twall/jna).
